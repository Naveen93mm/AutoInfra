I developed an infrastructure automation project named “AutoInfra” to demonstrate the use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform and server automation with Linux. Using Terraform scripts, I provisioned AWS EC2 instances and configured security groups to control network access. Once the infrastructure was created, I used Linux shell scripts to automate server setup tasks such as installing packages, configuring services, and preparing the environment for application deployment. This approach made the infrastructure easily repeatable, consistent, and scalable. By integrating Terraform, AWS, and Linux scripting, this project highlights my ability to combine IaC and DevOps practices for efficient server deployment and management.
